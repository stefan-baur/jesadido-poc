# Jesadido - Proof of Concept

This open source project implements the proof of concept of a new approach to **dismantle language barriers** by using of an emerging **formal Esperanto** called **Jesadido**.
Especially, Jesadido might be used for the generating of adequate translated content.

## Basic Approach

The basic approach of this language project is the **creating of a uniquely parsable formal Esperanto** providing the generating of **adequate translated content** for all involved target languages.
This is required **for language-barrier-free, but stakeholder-based communication**.

## Main Features

- **Parsing of Jesadido-code** to get an unique abstract syntax tree (AST)
- **Generating of adequate translated content** for following languages:
  - English (`en`)
  - Esperanto (`eo`)
  - French (`fr`)
  - German (`de`)
  - **Jesadido** (`ji`)
  - Spanish (`es`)
- **Pretty-Print-Disambiguation** depending on lexical, syntactical and semantical definitions of involved target languages
- **Providing a multilingual console**, a user interface for simultaneously multilingual content-writing
- **X-platformed code-generation** to get **internationalization components** for existing software solutions
- **Providing a main application** for pleasant exploring/using the features of this language project

## Continuation Possibilities

- Multilinugal chats, fora, shops and websites
- Language lerning games
- Low-cost software internationalization

## Delimitation

This project is the implementation of a **prototypical, standalone, all-in-one, non-headless application** to show the feasibility of the above approach and its possibilities, only.
A scalable cloud solution with a huge set of target languages should be realized with best effort, if this language projekt really works.
